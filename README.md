# DataRes S22 Research App
### Remarks from Research Head

Hello! My name is Irsyad, and I'm going to be your new Research head. I'm not as much of a genius as Colin, but I'll prepare more to fill that gap, and make sure that the quality of your code increases no matter what.

I want to build a team that not only has extremely competent coding prowess and communication skills to build and translate quality code, but also is super tight knit and close to each other! I want it to be so that during weekly meet ups, we're locked in, but after, we go grab a bite or something lol idk. 

Overall, just head over to [ResearchApps.ipynb], click on the "Open in Colab" button save a copy of the notebook, and get to coding! After you're done, send me the file at irsyadadam@g.ucla.edu with the subject "DataRes Research Applications," and you should get a confirmation email back.
  
I can't wait to meet you all and it's gonna be a wild ride :)

### Thanks, Irsyad Adam
